#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on reviewing the 'review' sections.
  2. Next, we investigated the callback function. Then commended/will delete out the unneeded javascript code section from new.html
  3. After that, we took on the comment sections and answered them as best as we could. Which functions in regard to the CRUID and the MVC diagram and the articleView.js methods.
